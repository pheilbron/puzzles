# define PHILLIP_MSG "Variations on a Theme:\n\nEach of these puzzles has been a variation on a strange loop, some profound and some mundane.\nA strange loop is an object, process, etc. which replicates itself producing the uncanny impression in\nthe viewer that one finds themselves exactly where they began. To learn more, investigate Douglas\nHofstadter's seminal work on the matter, \"Godel, Escher, Bach.\"\n\nIn many ways, you'll find the piscine is like a strange loop, ending up more or less exactly where you\nbegan, and yet no matter how well you've done, how well you will do, you have all gained something.\n\nIt's been quite a joy to be one of your prefects this months. You've all come incredibly far. Best of\nluck on the exam. I can't wait to see all of you return as cadets!\n\n\tPhillip H."
