One final note for those of you who made it this far:

When we're holding our breath underwater and it starts to feel like we can't keep
going, remember this: That sensation, that burning in your lungs, that's not our
body's way of telling us we're out of air, it's just responding to the increased CO2.
There's always one more second, one more push up, one more minute, one more test case,
one last push left in the tank. In those moments, it's not our body that lets us down,
it's our mind.

Push through and see where it gets you.

p.s. If you haven't found it yet, the header file's still out there...
